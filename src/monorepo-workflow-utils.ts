/**
 * For a monorepo, the process works like this:
 *
 * - The script generates a release spec template, listing the workspace
 *   packages in the project that have changed since the last release (or all of
 *   the packages if this would be the first release).
 * - The script then presents the template to the user so that they can specify
 *   the desired versions for each package. It first does this by attempting to
 *   locate an appropriate code editor on the user's computer (using the
 *   `EDITOR` environment variable if that is defined, otherwise `code` if it is
 *   present) and opening the file there, pausing while the user is editing the
 *   file. If no editor can be found, the script provides the user with the path
 *   to the template so that they can edit it themselves, then exits.
 * - However the user has edited the file, the script will parse and validate
 *   the information in the file, then apply the desired changes to the
 *   monorepo.
 * - Finally, once it has made the desired changes, the script will create a Git
 *   commit that includes the changes, then create a branch using the current
 *   date as the name.
 *
 * @param options - The options.
 * @param options.project - Information about the project.
 * @param options.tempDirectoryPath - A directory in which to hold the generated
 * release spec file.
 * @param options.firstRemovingExistingReleaseSpecification - Sometimes it's
 * possible for a release specification that was created in a previous run to
 * stick around (due to an error). This will ensure that the file is removed
 * first.
 * @param options.today - The current date.
 * @param options.stdout - A stream that can be used to write to standard out.
 * @param options.stderr - A stream that can be used to write to standard error.
